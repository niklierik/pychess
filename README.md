# Chess Rougelike game

Inspired by: [Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1972440/Shotgun_King_The_Final_Checkmate/)

## Basic Gameplay

The player plays with the black pieces.

First the AI takes two turns. At the beginning it can do only legal chess moves but as the player become stronger, the AI learns new powers too.

Then the player comes. The player's turn consist the following:
It can move with a piece then use an item with the moved piece.
Each piece can own a weapon.
Weapons have cooldown, shooting it has a one-turn cooldown.
Items are shared between pieces, but they have an amount.

### Ending of a match:

> Lack of material

The Black king has ranged attack options therefore only having only just a king (also note that the black player has only a King in the beginning!) is not a problem for Black.

> Stalemate

Stalemate should not be possible with pieces having guns, also the goal is to capture / kill the enemy king, therefore there are no checks.

> Checkmate

There are no checks therefore no checkmates. The goal is to keep your king alive while capturing / killing the enemy king.

### Winning / Losing

If you lose then it is the end of the save and you need to try again.

If you win then you can pick an upgrade, then it is rematch time. But be aware! You have not just picked an upgrade for yourself but also for white!
